# Drupal7DBviewer
a tool for viewing the website databases

##### Do not commit the databases to GitHub.  If you do, delete this repo quickly or make it private.  We need secrets.

#### How to use:

 - make a folder named 'shared' in this folder.  Put your sql dumps there.
 - a folder named 'db_data' will be created on first run.  It will hold your mysql-loaded data automatically.
 - run the script with `docker-compose up`.  Wait a few hours on first load while the database populates.
 - view your database objects at http://localhost:5150 :devilhorns
 - break your databases as you please -- they are your local copy and not tied to any production server.
 
##### ./shared/ and ./db_data/ shall not be committed.
